Investment Insight Platform (IIP) - UI/UX Design Proposal
This document outlines the proposed design and user flow for the platform, blending the familiar, efficient UI of Reddit with the specific, bias-reducing workflow required for CIM analysis.

Core Principle: "Analysis Before Influence"
Every design decision is guided by this principle. A user must provide their own analysis before they can see the analysis of their teammates.

Page 1: The Deal Flow Dashboard (The "Home Page")
This is the main screen users see upon logging in. It's a clean, high-level overview of all active and past deals.

Layout:

Header: A simple, clean bar at the top.

Left: Company/Team Logo and Platform Name ("IIP").

Right: A prominent + Upload CIM button, a search bar, and a user profile icon (showing who is logged in).

Main Content Area: A feed of "CIM Posts," similar to Reddit, but with a professional, data-driven layout. Each post is a card.

The "CIM Post" Card:
Each card in the feed represents one CIM and contains essential, at-a-glance information.

CIM Title: e.g., "Project Titan - SaaS Acquisition" (from the filename).

Key AI-Generated Tags: A row of tags pulled from the AI summary (e.g., Industry: Enterprise SaaS, Stage: Growth Equity, Revenue: $25M ARR). This allows for quick filtering.

Status Badge: A colored badge indicating the current state:

ðŸ”µ Feedback Required: You have not submitted your feedback yet.

ðŸŸ¢ Review Complete: You have submitted your feedback.

âšª Archived: The deal process is complete.

Action Button: A single, clear button: View Analysis & Add Feedback.

Page 2: The Analysis & Feedback Page (The "Post Detail" Page)
This is where the core workflow happens. Clicking View Analysis & Add Feedback on a CIM card takes the user here. The page has a two-column layout.

Column 1: AI-Generated Analysis (The "Report")

This entire column is dedicated to the structured JSON output from your backend.

It's presented in a clean, readable format.

Header: CIM Title.

Sections: Collapsible sections for each key in your JSON analysis.

Executive Summary (Expanded by default)

Financials (Key metrics, charts)

Products & Services

Market & Competition

Key Risks & Mitigants

Team

Column 2: The "Blind" Feedback Module (The "Comment Section")
This is the most critical part of the UX. Its appearance changes based on whether the user has submitted their feedback.

State A: User Has NOT Submitted Feedback

A large, inviting text area is the main focus.

Prompt: "What is your initial analysis? Please outline your key thoughts, questions, and concerns below."

Button: Submit & View Team Feedback.

Crucially, below this module, there is a message: "The team's feedback will become visible once you submit your own analysis." There is no hint of how many comments there are or who has commented.

State B: User HAS Submitted Feedback

The text area is replaced by a read-only view of "Your Submitted Analysis."

Below that, the "Team Feedback" section now appears.

This is a list of all submitted comments.

Anonymity: Each comment is presented in a simple card with only the text and a timestamp (e.g., "Submitted 2 hours ago"). There are no names or profile pictures. All comments look identical.

The Workflow in Action (Function #3)
This design directly enables your third requested function: sending CIMs to team members and gathering blind, anonymous feedback.

Upload: A team member clicks + Upload CIM. The file is processed by your backend.

Notification (Future Feature): The system can notify all team members that a new CIM is ready for review.

Individual Review: Each team member logs in, sees the new CIM on their dashboard with the Feedback Required status.

Forced Independent Thought: They click into the Analysis Page. They can read the AI summary but cannot see any colleague's thoughts. They are forced to form their own opinion and write it down.

Reveal: Once they click Submit & View Team Feedback, their feedback is saved, and they immediately see the (anonymous) thoughts of everyone else who has already commented.

Unbiased Discussion: Now, the team can have a meeting or discussion, with everyone having already contributed their independent, unbiased initial thoughts.
